title: How to set up a Capital IQ account
---

1. [Email business librarian Ian Moore](mailto:imoore@d.umn.edu) to request access. When he receives your request, Ian will pass it on to Capital IQ customer service, which will create an account under your UMD email. After your account is created, you will receive an email from Capital IQ confirming account creation. You'll usually receive the email in about 1 business day.

2. Go to [the library's databases list](https://libguides.d.umn.edu/az.php?q=capital%20iq) and follow the link there to Capital IQ, where you will be able to log in.

    >__Don't__ follow the registration link you receive in the email from Capital IQ. That link won't work. You'll need to use the link to the library's databases page above. The link on the databases page will take you through the library's proxy servers and give you the access you need.

3. Now you're ready to use Capital IQ! You can always access Capital IQ [through the library's databases list](https://libguides.d.umn.edu/az.php?q=capital%20iq).
