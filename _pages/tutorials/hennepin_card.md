title: How to set up a card with the Hennepin County Library
---

1. Make sure you have either a card from the Arrowhead Library System or a card from the Duluth Public Library. (Other Minnesota library cards will work as well â€” these are just the public library systems local to UMD.)

2. Visit [the Hennepin Count Library site](https://www.hclib.org/en/about/library-cards).

3. Under "Minnesota residents (outside of Hennepin County)" click "Ask Us" and chat with Hennepin County Library staff. They'll be happy to help you set up a card!

4. Once your card is ready to go, you can add it to the Libby app. You can find instructions for how to do that on [the Libby site](https://help.libbyapp.com/en-us/6009.htm).
